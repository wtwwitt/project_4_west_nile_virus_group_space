Every year from Late May to Early October, public health workers setup mosquito 
traps scattered across the city

the mosquitos are tested for the presence of West Nile virus before the end of the 
week. The test results include the number of mosquitos, the mosquitos species, 
and whether or not West Nile virus is present in the cohort.
